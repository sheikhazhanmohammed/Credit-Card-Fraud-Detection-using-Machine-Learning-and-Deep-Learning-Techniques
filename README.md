This repository contains the files for various machine learning and deep learning algorithms that have been used in our submission for Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques paper at 2020 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Sustainable Systems (ICISS). The paper can be found [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9316002).  
A list of the ML and DL algorithms that have been used are:  
- [Multiple Linear Regression](https://github.com/sheikhazhanmohammed/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques/blob/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb)
- [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/sheikhazhanmohammed/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Classifier.ipynb)
- [K Nearest Neighbours](https://github.com/sheikhazhanmohammed/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbours.ipynb)
- [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://github.com/sheikhazhanmohammed/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques/blob/main/Gaussian%20Naive%20Bayes%20Classifier.ipynb)
- [Random Forest Classifier](https://github.com/sheikhazhanmohammed/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques/blob/main/Random%20Forest%20Classifier.ipynb)
- [Neural Network Classifier](https://github.com/sheikhazhanmohammed/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning-Techniques/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20Classifier.ipynb)

The neural network classifier contains a custom loss function, which helps to deal with the dataset imbalance. The dataset is taken from Kaggle, and is available in the Dataset folder.
